# Naive Bayes From Scratch

## Part 1
Creating a python class that implements Gaussian Naive Bayes from scratch.
The conditional probabilities are calculated as follows:

## Part 2
Testing the performance and accuracy of my implementation against the GaussianNB implementation in scikit-learn. Using the following datasets for testing:
- Penguins_af.csv
- GlassV2.csv
- Diabetes.csv
